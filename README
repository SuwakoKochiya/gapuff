One sentence to introduce this project:
A Gaussian multi-puff gas dipersion model using PyCUDA/CUDA to accelerate the computation.

About the performance:
The model was developed against with GTX570/CUDA 4.0, but also tested under GTS250/CUDA3.0. It showed huge acceleration comparing with Intel i7 workstation. The computation would comsume about 30 seconds to compute a middle-size accident as default configuration in source codes.
